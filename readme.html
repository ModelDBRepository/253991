This model was contributed by Dejan Zecevic.<p/>
This model requires NEURON which is freely available from <a href="http://neuron.yale.edu">http://neuron.yale.edu</a><p/>
Usage:<p/>
To run the model (linux/unix) compile the mod file with a command like<p/>
nrnivmodl<p/>
or for mswin or mac use makenrndll. Start with the mosinit.hoc file (linux):<p/>
nrngui mosinit.hoc<p/>
or by double clicking (mswin) or dragging and dropping (mac). If you need more
help to run the simulation on your platform please consult this page:<p/>

<p/>
After running the model you should see the propagation of a passive EPSP into  the tuft compartments similar to Fig 3G trace 3 in the paper:<p/>

This model entry includes a mitral cell morphology with a detailed reconstruction of a tuft (slightly more elaborate than the one depicted in Fig 3G in the paper)
 depicted below in a shape plot with show diameter shape style selected<p/>
